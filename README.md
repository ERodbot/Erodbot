#  ‚ú® About me

**'Cybernet enthusiast and creative mind'**

Hi! I'm Emanuel Rodr√≠guez, a CS student at ITCR, Costa Rica and an extremely curius mind, that's why I'm always trying to expand my kwnoedge about many different topics. I believe in the power of words, and the potential that everyone has if they believe in themselfs and have the correct guidence. 
I am hard-working and compromised, and set goals to myself to both challenge me and improve. 
Here is some information about me:

Technical Skills: Proficient in many programming languages and ditigal tools. I've been an asistant for the IT support team of the Computer Engineering School in ITCR for a year and helped many professors and students solve a wide array of technical problems. 

Some of the languages and technologies that I have experience on are:

* python
* javascript
* c
* java
* node.js
* react
* angular
* mongodb
* postresql
* sql server
* figma
* postman

Interests: My current interests include: Iot, IT, cybersecurity, operatong systems and im currently improving my skills in low level learning, network protocols and server and hardware oriented programming. 

Collaboration: as a student and as part of a team of IT support, I've experienced and learn to collaborate with others and the importance of effective communications. I'm a firm believer in the idea that leaders should be compassionate but firm, and that working as a team means learning to make the best out of your own skills and being willing to learn new things from others, as well as pushing others to improve their own skills.
